# Real Football 2011 Vita

<p align="center"><img src="./screenshots/game.png"></p>

This is a wrapper/port of <b>Real Football 2011</b> for the *PS Vita*.

The port works by loading the official Android/Xperia Armv7 executable in memory, resolving its imports with native functions and patching it in order to properly run.
By doing so, it's basically as if we emulate a minimalist Android environment in which we run natively the executable as is.

## Changelog

### v1.0

- Initial release.

## Note

This port works has been tested with the Xperia v.1.0.3 build with physical controls support.

## Setup Instructions (For End Users)

In order to properly install the game, you'll have to follow these steps precisely:

- Install [kubridge](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/kubridge/releases/) and [FdFix](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/FdFix/releases/) by copying `kubridge.skprx` and `fd_fix.skprx` to your taiHEN plugins folder (usually `ux0:tai`) and adding two entries to your `config.txt` under `*KERNEL`:
  
```
  *KERNEL
  ux0:tai/kubridge.skprx
  ux0:tai/fd_fix.skprx
```

**Note** Don't install fd_fix.skprx if you're using rePatch plugin

- **Optional**: Install [PSVshell](https://github.com/Electry/PSVshell/releases) to overclock your device to 500Mhz.
- Install `libshacccg.suprx`, if you don't have it already, by following [this guide](https://samilops2.gitbook.io/vita-troubleshooting-guide/shader-compiler/extract-libshacccg.suprx).
- Obtain your copy of *Real Football 2011* legally for Android or Sony Xperia Play in form of an `.apk` file and an `.obb` file. [You can get all the required files directly from your phone](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11012976/how-do-i-get-the-apk-of-an-installed-app-without-root-access) or by using an apk extractor you can find in the play store.
- Open the apk with your zip explorer and extract the file `librealfootball.so` from the `lib/armeabi-v7a` folder to `ux0:data/realfootball`.
- Open the obb with your zip explorer and extract the `gameloft` folder inside it in `ux0:data/realfootball`.

## Build Instructions (For Developers)

In order to build the loader, you'll need a [vitasdk](https://github.com/vitasdk) build fully compiled with softfp usage.  
You can find a precompiled version here: https://github.com/vitasdk/buildscripts/actions/runs/1102643776.  
Additionally, you'll need these libraries to be compiled as well with `-mfloat-abi=softfp` added to their CFLAGS:

- [SoLoud](https://github.com/vitasdk/packages/blob/master/soloud/VITABUILD)

- [libmathneon](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/math-neon)

  - ```bash
    make install
    ```

- [vitaShaRK](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/vitaShaRK)

  - ```bash
    make install
    ```

- [kubridge](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/kubridge)

  - ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. && make install
    ```

- [vitaGL](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/vitaGL)

  - ````bash
    make NO_DEBUG=1 SOFTFP_ABI=1 CIRCULAR_VERTEX_POOL=2 PHYCONT_ON_DEMAND=1 install
    ````

After all these requirements are met, you can compile the loader with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```

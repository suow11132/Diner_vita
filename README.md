# Spongebob diner dash Vita


This is a wrapper/port of <b>Spongebob diner dash</b> for the *PS Vita*.

The port works by loading the official Android Armv6 executable in memory, resolving its imports with native functions and patching it in order to properly run.
By doing so, it's basically as if we emulate a minimalist Android environment in which we run natively the executable as is.

## Changelog

### v1.0

- Initial release.

## Note

THIS PORT IS NOT finished yet so you can't download it... yet
